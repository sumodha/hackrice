            <p>At <b>CareNet</b>, we believe that access to support should be simple, clear, and compassionate. Too often, individuals and families struggle to find the social welfare programs they qualify for — not because help doesn’t exist, but because it’s hard to navigate a maze of applications, requirements, and agencies. That’s where we come in.</p>
            <p>CareNet is a platform designed to connect people with the right social welfare programs based on their unique eligibility. Whether it’s healthcare, housing, food assistance, education, or community resources, we help you find programs quickly and confidently.</p>
            <p>Our mission is simple:</p>
            <p><b>Accessibility</b> – Break down barriers so that anyone can understand and access support.</p>
            <p><b>Connection</b> – Bridge the gap between people in need and the programs that serve them.</p>
            <p><b>Empowerment</b> – Give individuals and families the tools they need to thrive, not just survive.</p>
            <p>We’re more than a website — we’re a network of care, working to ensure that no one falls through the cracks.</p>
